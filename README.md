# MMAE-540
Includes Homework and Projects from MMAE 540 Robotics Class

Tractor trailer and differential drive files are part of the final project for this class that included simulatiions of a tractor trailer with multiple trailers and a differential drive robot. 

TractorTrailerFWD.m simulates a "tricycle" type tractor trailer with two trailers from a straight line to a circular path.

TractorTrailerToTarget.m builds upon the tractor trailer simulated in TractorTrailerFWD.m and runs to a target while avoiding obstacles by incorporating a path planning algorithm.

DifferentialDriveTest.m tested the kinematic equations of a differential drive robot, the wheel speeds can be changed manually to visualize difference manuevers that may be implemented.

DDPathAndObstacleAvoid.m uses the kinematics of the differential drive robot tested in DifferentialDriveTest.m and implements them with a path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithm to simulate a differential drive robot approaching a target and avaoiding obstacles.
